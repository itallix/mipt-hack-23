# Telegram Bot powered by Gemini Pro

## Prerequisites

1. [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
    ```

1. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

    ```bash
    brew install ngrok
    ```

1. [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

    ```bash
    brew install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```

1. [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

    ```bash
    brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
    ```

## Running jupyterlab

```bash
poetry install
poetry run jupyter lab
```

## Running bot locally

1. Make sure you have access to the Google project `mipt-hack-01` (contact tg: @fancyeagle if not)

   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

1. Register your bot for testing with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and save a telegram token as env variable:

    ```bash
    export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=some_value
    ```

1. If you didn't create a virtual environment with poetry before, create it:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

1. Execute the following commands in terminal to start bot service locally:

    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=bot_service.app:app
    export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5005
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    export PROJECT_ID=mipt-hack-01
    poetry run flask run --reload
    ```

1. Create a tunnel for the local HTTP server from the previous step using `ngrok`, making it accessible from the
public internet:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 127.0.0.1:5005
    ```

1. Using `sh/webhook.sh` script, register the webhook with Telegram API, so that the bot will trigger local service
on each request:

    ```bash
    sh sh/webhook.sh set <PUBLIC_URL> <TELEGRAM_TOKEN>
    ```

    - `PUBLIC_URL` - the url generated by ngrok on step 4, e.g.: `https://fce9-2a02-a447-94fc-1-50f5-8a25-6ab-eecc.ngrok.io`
    - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` - the token generated by BotFather on step 1

1. After you finished with testing, you can disconnect your bot using the following command:

    ```bash
    sh sh/webook.sh delete <TELEGRAM_TOKEN>
    ```

## Running BDD tests

To ensure the model accurately recognizes artwork, a set of Behavior-Driven Development
(BDD) tests has been created. These tests verify that the model's responses correctly
match the paintings and landmarks present in the photo.

Before running tests, download [data.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15pBo5il84sa6OylYLhCTTbzAjabUDqNs/view?usp=drive_link)
and extract it to `tests/bdd` folder.

Running all tests:

   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/bdd
   ```

Running tests for category:

   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/bdd -k "paintings"
   poetry run pytest tests/bdd -k "landmarks"
   ```

It appears that the model incorrectly identified the painting "The Stroll at Giverny"
by Claude Monet as "Woman and Children in a Field" by Berthe Morisot.
This misidentification can be due to several factors related to the model's training
and the inherent challenges in artwork recognition.
